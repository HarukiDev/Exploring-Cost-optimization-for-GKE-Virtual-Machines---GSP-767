## üöÄ Exploring Cost Optimization for GKE Virtual Machines (GSP-767)

This lab provides a setup script to quickly configure the required resources.  
However, ‚ö†Ô∏è **it's better to do the steps manually first** so you understand what‚Äôs happening.  
Once you are confident, you can run the script below in **Google Cloud Shell**:

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarukiDev/Exploring_Cost_optimization_for_GKE_Virtual_Machines---GSP-767/main/setup.sh
sudo chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
